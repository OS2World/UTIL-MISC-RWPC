Porting RWPC to other Platforms / Compilers
===========================================

All source is supposed to be 100% ANSI C, except for one operating system
specific file (os2file.c for OS/2).

If you port rwpc to another platform, create a new file (e.g. linuxfile.c)
which provides all the functions declared in osfile.h.

If necessary, adapt macros.h, using #ifdefs.

Create a new makefile in which you change the OSFILE macro to compile and
link in your new file instead of os2file.c.

Send me your changes, and I will be glad to incorporate them in the original
archive.
